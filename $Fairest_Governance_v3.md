This governance protocol as been set to allow members to create 10 proposals without making a deposit of their tokens - you just need to hold $fairest in other words - if one moves past having made 10 proposals one would need to deposit tokens within the protocol to expand once governance capability beyond this restriction.

This protocol makes proposals pass the moment x amount of time has passed from the moment when the proposal was made, which is possible to set at a per instance basis. The system also currently has a preset that necessitates activity if a proposal is to be allowed to past and executed before time-limits have passed. This is achieved via a Quorum function that currently rests at a 20% of total free-floating supply of the token. 

A long term alternativ to maintain the $fairest protocol over time is to, in a later iterations of the governance protocol, allow the community to early on vote about if its interested in introducing quadratic voting into the system - which reduces the risk of a concentration of power occuring containing a distruptive force towards the maintance of the $fairest protocol instead allowing for the rise of the tyranny of the majority. 

This also allow for better ways of polling the shared will of the community via a clearer protocol output interface since votes can be distributed at a per vote basis for any participant in multiple-choice polls. 

In other words if you have 3 options and 1000 tokens you can allocate when voting you're able to freely distribute say 300 votes for option A, 400 votes for option B and 300 votes for option C all whilst the value of votes made is regulated by a quadratic cost function which in short regulates both the power of large holders of community tokens and small holders of community tokens within the system to make votes contain a greater degree of fairness than a pure 1 token 1 vote system.
The protocol furthermore currently contains a 1 council token which will have to be addressed in a later poll within the community. Currently this token brings with it a VETO function. This allows for the system whilst in the custodial phase, to deny community proposal which could be deemed to be harmful for the projects progression - in other words this offers something similar to a root function within the voting platform.
This is not a function which I think later iterations of this Projects development should necessitate. In other words I wish it will cease to exist when the Community doesn't need this "$Responsibility-token" held in anyones sole hand or in the hands of a select few (since the council token is able to be fractionalized). 

The change in structure for how many of these tokens exist, being it 1 or more or even none something which I suggested the community later will vote about but only when by the whole community deemed necessary. 

This vote preferably occurs when the Community is comfortable with using existing voting mechanics whilst continously feeding the polling system with proposals whereamong one of them comes to result in a proposition to changes the DAO structure being one of these polls which are born out of the community itself. 

The plattform allows for executive polls to be made, which propose changes to the configuration of the existing system into new iterations and this is possible for the community to suggest which is why this might be something which gets realized in the future.
In other words I suggest that this function later only exist as a legacy feature unless the community decides that the need arises for it to once more come back into existence for reasons only the future will have to tell us about.
Preferably the Community itself has total control over its polling board without any need for guidance. That is what could be envisioned as a optimal scenario where the Power within the DAO feeds upon itself maintaining its own existence by mere interest in allowing it to keep on creating.
If we in a later stage see the need to connect further functions to the governance suite that we're using, if their use would allow for the DAO to grow into something that the community wishes --- then that can be proposed within the Realms polling system and later on implemented by DEVS.
To continue on describing the current governance setup that exists within the current governance plattform we need to touch upon how the community holds a VETO right towards proposals laid forth by the council token if its something which 42% of votes decides shouldn't be executed upon. 

The economic system deployed by DeFiHope is in contrast to Realms an autonomous project which builds via Realms gets integrated into this governance system which offers the community polling functionality using the the deployed token contract.
Perhaps I'm getting esoteric here, but I'm certain some of you still are following along.
For the moment the Community vote tipping mechanic is set to a 1 day voting window which after initial system setup preferably gets set to a by the community agreed upon duration in accordance with what by vote is decided as the $fairest voting window. 

The current setup has been enacted to allow for the first votes made within the community to execute quickly. 

Apart from the time-based voting procedure the strict community vote tipping which currently regulates the voting procedure also allows for votes which gain a quorum to - when they hit a threshhold making up a total 20% of total circulation supply or if the vote reaches a point of mathematical certainty that the suggestion is unable to be defeated - execute immediately.

The current protocl enacted within the dApp interacts to give you a DAO system which works towards at the current stage of the development of the $fairest protocol, to grow the Community and steering its path in the $fairest way towards the future.

The protocol is however as previously mentioned an autonomous system, this mean that the power of the protocol always stands in direct parallell to community members using it for governace. See it as a forum where how many tokens you hold also decides how much influence you hold over the outcome of the polls themselves whilst the plattform itself has no more true executive power than controlling the polling function which it gives you access to.
As previously mentioned, to reduce slughishness in the system, for the time being, the community approval quorum is set to equal 20%. This setting is recommended that one tweaks in accordance with what later is deemed to work better for optimal executions of Community polls/ commands and in extension communication.
This system is what gives you access to influence the development of this project by holding $fairest tokens. If community decisions are brought forth via proposals and a following poll it gives you the ability to judge if the development team is executing on the will of the community or not,  it allows discussion and innovation and later allows for you to be guide in deciding how big of a part you want to be in influencing the future of the token itself and the systems that get built into it. 

Essentially you get access to screening dev-team performance, influencing and creating a continously evolving roadmap and analyze performance based upon delivery of promises over time.
The long-term goal is for power to be completely passed over to the Community itself which we envision as an end stage - full maturity vote - but this decision is recommended to both have to originate from within a proposal brought forth from within the community itself whilst also being enacted during a period where the Quorum setting for passing this vote equals f.ex that a 42% threshhold of votes need to be in favour of the proposal being passed.

This vote would essentially equal that all council tokens are revoked and the power gets completely handed to the community itself erasing the existence of VETO powers.

Another function - which I would describe as experimental for web3 - is the ability to introduce proof of uniqueness into the governance protocol. This could be enacted by the community to introduce a concept called "Civic passes" which could be viewed as a type of community passport/citizenship. This system would introduce further protection towards the DAOs independence as an autonomous organisation within web3. 
This is however a system that could be deemed controversial to use since it requires the use of biometric data which is held and encrypted by the Realms dApp.
Realms offers a lot more in regards to allowing for the implementation of future governance plugins for the DAO but at the current governance stage the protocols introduce allows for what currently is needed within the @FairestLaunch governance $fairest protocol.
All Community members can vote, if someone wishes to create a proposal it requires holding a minimum of $Fairest x 250.000 (which at time of writing equals an aproximate current market price of $100).

Please note that the specifics like token names and amounts should be checked for accuracy in your actual system documentation.
