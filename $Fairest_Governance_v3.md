Governance Protocol Overview
This governance protocol allows members to create up to 10 proposals without needing to deposit tokens; you simply need to hold $Fairest tokens in a wallet of your choice and confirm ownership towards the Realms dApp to gain access. However, once you exceed this limit, depositing tokens within the protocol is required to expand your governance capabilities.

Proposal Execution and Time Frames

Proposals pass automatically after a set amount of time from their creation, with the duration adjustable on a per-instance basis. The system also mandates activity for a proposal to pass before the time limit elapses, achieved through a Quorum function currently set at 20% of the total free-floating $Fairest token supply.

Future Governance Enhancements
In future iterations, the community might vote on introducing quadratic voting to mitigate the risk of power concentration and prevent the 'tyranny of the majority.' 

Quadratic voting would in such an instance distribute voting power more equitably by allowing votes to be allocated across multiple options in polls, where each vote's cost increases quadratically. 

This approach can lead to a more nuanced expression of community will, especially in multi-choice scenarios. 

For example, with 1000 tokens, you might allocate 300 votes to option A, 400 to option B, and 300 to option C, with each allocation subject to quadratic cost.

Council Token and Veto Power

The protocol currently features one council token with veto power, serving as a safeguard during the project's custodial phase to deny potentially harmful proposals. 
I advocate for this function to be phased out once the community matures, suggesting that the number and necessity of these tokens should be determined by community vote when deemed appropriate.

Community-Driven Evolution
The platform supports executive polls for suggesting and implementing new system configurations. This feature might become a legacy function unless the community sees a need for it. 
Ideally, the community would control its polling board autonomously, fostering self-sustaining governance. Further governance functionalities could be proposed and integrated via the Realms polling system if they enhance the DAO's growth and align with community wishes.

Voting Mechanics
The community can veto proposals made by the council token if 42% of votes oppose the council suggestion. The current setup allows for rapid execution of initial community votes, with a one-day voting window set to later be adjusted to the $fairest vote by community consensus.

Votes can execute immediately if they achieve a quorum of 20% of the circulating supply or if mathematically certain to pass.

Economic and Governance Integration

The system, integrated through how the current contracts have been deployed and via Realms still supports development of autonomous projects within the $fairest governance framework, allowing token holders to influence project development directly. 
The protocol's power parallels the community's engagement, with influence determined by token holdings.

Long-Term Goals

The ultimate aim is to transition full governance control to the community, potentially through a maturity vote requiring, for example, a 42% quorum to pass without and eliminate the veto power associated with council tokens.

Future experimental Features
An experimental feature that could be introduced in the future includes the introduction of "Civic passes" or community passports, which could enhance the DAO autonomy by using biometric data for identity verification, though this might be controversial due to privacy concerns.

Proposal Creation

All community members can vote, but creating a proposal requires holding at least 250,000 $Fairest tokens, which at the time of writing corresponds to a market value of approximately $100.
Please verify token names and exact figures with the most current data for accuracy.
