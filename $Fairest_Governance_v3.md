The suggested deployment of governance would essentially be this.

This governance protocol enables members to create up to 10 proposals without the need to deposit any tokens; you only need to hold $FAIREST. However, once you've made 10 proposals, you must deposit tokens into the protocol to extend your governance capabilities beyond this limit.

The protocol is designed so that this exact suggestion passes automatically after a specified time from when it was submitted, which can be set on a per-instance basis or it can if the community wants be set to different voting systems (even quadratic voting) and biometric proof of uniqueness ensuring fair voting systems which contains this function if that is what later is proposed and enacted in a vote.

This system currently includes one council token with VETO rights, allowing it to block community proposals, functioning somewhat like a root control. However, I believe this feature should be phased out in future iterations of the project. 

Ideally, this "responsibility token" would no longer be held by any single entity when the community feels ready and that’s what it wants. Any changes to the structure of how these tokens are distributed should only be voted on when the community consensus deems it necessary, and should occur once the community is comfortable with managing proposals and voting mechanics independently.

In essence, this veto function should remain as a legacy feature unless the community decides there's a future need for it to be reinstated.
The vision is for the community to have complete control over its governance without external guidance. This scenario would be optimal, where the power within the DAO sustains itself through the community's interest in its continuation and development.

If further functions are needed for the governance suite later on and the community supports the growth their shared visions, I hope they will be integrated accordingly.
Currently, the community can veto a proposal made by the wielder of the council token if 42% of the votes oppose the proposal being enacted in a vote.

The total free-float of the token when we exclude all LP-tokens which are locked in liquidity pools amount to 220 363 425 tokens.

This a system that seamlessly interacts with the economic system deployed by DeFiHope, which autonomously enhances the functionality of the contract and what the members can do together.

I might be getting a bit abstract here, but I believe many of you are still following.

At present, the community vote tipping mechanism operates on a one-day voting period. Once passed, this protocol will be enacted within the dApp, providing a DAO system to grow and steer the community's future.

Upon completion of the vote, the system will switch to a strict protocol where votes pass the moment they reach a point of mathematical certainty that they cannot be overturned.

To reduce system delays, the Community Approval Quorum is currently set at 20% of total free supply of $Fairest - but this percentage is possible to adjust based on what proves effective for swift execution of community decisions and communication.

The system holds power only as long as you allow it, and as long as the developers continue to fulfill their promises or after governance is fully transferred to the hands of the community. 

This transition should be decided through a community vote that achieves quorum and isn't vetoed by the single development token.

I also believe there's an in-built kill-switch for the community if they collectively decide to do a CTO (Change of Total Ownership/"Community Take Over"), which would effectively transfer control and power over the Realms dApp deployment. If you're curious about how it works, I suggest reading up on it.

All community members can vote; to propose, one must hold at least $FAIREST worth 250,000 (approximately $100).

This vote will conclude one day from when this proposal was made and will then be executed.

Please note that the specifics like token names and amounts should be checked for accuracy in your actual system documentation.
